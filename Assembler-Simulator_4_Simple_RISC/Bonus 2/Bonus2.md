# Instructions for Question 5 and Rubric

This Question is to be evaluated manually, and carries a total of *7 marks*. You are given *5 test cases* that are in the form of a word problem. Give these to your students and ask them to solve the same using their CLIs. 

**Kindly Reward the student marks even if their process of taking inputs or giving outputs is different from what has been mentioned in the document. Award marks only if the output is correct.**
  


## Type 1 
### 2 marks Total 
#### Test case 1 -- 2 marks
Consider an ISA which has 24 -bit long instructions. Suppose the ISA
supports the address space of 2 KiloBytes with byte-addressable memory and has 7 Bits assigned to representing registers. Given this,
answer the following questions:
* How many  minimum bits are needed to represent an address in this architecture
* Number  of bits needed by opcode
* Number of filler bits in Instruction type 2
* Maximum numbers of instructions this ISA can support
* Maximum number of registers this ISA can support

#### Answers:
> #### How many  minimum bits are needed to represent an address in this architecture
>> 11 bits                                 
>>> 0.5marks

>#### Number of bits needed by opcode
>> 6 bits
>>> 0.25marks

>#### Number of filler bits in Instruction type 2
>>4 bits
>>> 0.25marks

>#### Maximum numbers of instructions this ISA can support
>> 64                                     
>>> 0.5marks

>#### Maximum number of registers this ISA can support
>>128                                     
>>> 0.5marks



## Type 2 
### 2 marks Total
#### Test case 1 -- 1 mark
> Consider a 16 bit CPU supporting 128 kB of memory space. System is enhanced
from Nibble addressable to Byte addressable memory. How many address pins
are saved in enhanced CPU?
>> -1 (1 pin saved)



#### Test case 2 -- 1 mark
> Consider a 32 bit hypothetical CPU which supports 64kWord memory. System is
enhanced from word addressable to a Byte addressable memory. How many address pins are required
in the enhanced CPU to refer to complete memory?
>> +2 (2 pins required)


## Type 3
### 2 marks Total
#### Test case 1 -- 1 mark
>Consider a 4 bit hypothetical CPU. Pin configuration contains 34 Address Pins,
how much main memory is possible in the system in bytes when CPU supports Byte addressable memory
>> 16 GB

#### Test case 2 -- 1 mark
>Consider a 4 bit hypothetical CPU. Pin configuration contains 34 Address Pins,
how much main memory is possible in the system in bytes when CPU supports Word addressable memory
>> 8 GB


## Type 4 
### 1 mark Total
You are free to award 1 mark to the student based on your judgement of if the CLI was properly Usable or not. 

Do note that you arent allowed give partial marking here.
* *Even if the student didnt get correct outputs, they are still eligible for getting this mark.*
